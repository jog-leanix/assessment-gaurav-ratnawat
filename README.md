# Assessment Gaurav Ratnawat

We want to create an interactive application composed of a backend and frontend. Your task is to architect and develop the backend part of it. It is to be Kotlin based, using Quarkus as a framework and using Postgres for persistence.

üéØ Core Features: The core feature on the frontend involves designing a 50x50 grid interface. Each cell in the grid is interactive and can take on a value (the default value is 0). When a user clicks on any particular cell, the values in all the cells present in the same row and column get incremented by 1. If the cell was empty, it should now have a value of 1.

A secondary trait of the interactive grid is to identify the Fibonacci sequence. If the application detects 5 consecutive numbers from the Fibonacci sequence either horizontally or vertically, the cells carrying those values be cleared out (back to the value 0).

‚ö†Ô∏è Please make sure to have a way to show it working, either with logs, tests or with a small frontend.

‚è∞ We fully understand that many of our candidates have significant commitments and may not be able to dedicate extensive time to this coding challenge. If you find yourself constrained for time, please do not hesitate to prioritize those features and aspects of the application that best showcase your strengths, skills, and areas of expertise. In that case, feel free to list and explain potential enhancements.
